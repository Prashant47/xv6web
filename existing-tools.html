	<h2> 2.1 Current educational purpose operating systems </h2>
	<p  style="font-size:140%" >
	<br>
	We have studied some of the current available education purpose operating system OSes
	like XINU,sos,linux kernel v0.01,Bluefire OS,MINIX,jos, Plan 9. While studying all these
	operating systems we have followed guidelines based on following parameters:
	1. language code should be ANSI C.<br>
	2. should not have more that 15000 lines of code.<br>
	3. should follow one of the measure unix standard specifications.<br>
	4. should be open source and able to compile on qemu emulator in major linux distri-
	butions.<br>
	5. should have past history of being used for pedagogical purposes.<br>
	6. should have well documented manual.<br>
	A comprehensive study of each of these operating system is presented below.<br></p>
	
	
	<h2>2.1.1 XINU</h2>
	<p  style="font-size:140%" >
	<br>
	XINU [10] stands for Xinu Is Not Unix. It resembles concepts and even name with
	Unix, but the internal architecture is wholely different. Xinu is a small, elegant operating
	system that supports dynamic process creation, dynamic memory allocation, network
	communication, local and remote file systems, a shell and device-independent I/O func-
	tions. As XINU does not follow any UNIX standards, it falls apart from mainstream of
	operating system pedology.<br></p>
	
	<h2>2.1.2 SOS</h2>
	<br>
	<p  style="font-size:140%" >
	SOS [9] Simple Operating System, is an operating system kernel which aims at being
	simple to understand and that nonetheless covers concepts and functionalities of modern
	OSes. The OS code comes with a batch of articles published in the french magazine
	called Linux Magazine France, during 2004 and 2006. The main problem with SOS is
	most part of documentation is available in french and most of concepts are implemented
	in a standalone fashion, apart from standard UNIX prototype.<br></p>
	
	<h2>2.1.3 Linux Kernel v0.01</h2><br>
<p  style="font-size:140%" >
	This is earliest version of Linux kernel release in early 1991. It comprise of 8000 lines of
	code only. This can be the best tool for novice developers to learn Linux kernel because
	current code base has evolved from this tiny release v0.01. But the problem with this
	vanilla kernel is dependency and compiling environment has been changed significantly
	since 1991. So this linux-0.01 version can not be complied on today’s modern compilers.
	Even though it was written considering GCC, but GCC itself has changed a lot since
	1991. This difficulties make linux-0.01 unsuitable for use of pedagogy.<br></p>
	
	<h2>2.1.4 Bluefire OS</h2><br><p  style="font-size:140%" >
	Bluefire is a didactic OS that was created to show every step of creating a bootstrapping
	OS. It’s approximately 15,000 lines of code. It’s include primary graphics which is been
	shown while booting steps. This operating system lacks of some core functionalities like
	synchronization, standard memory management. The design of this operating system is
	quiet different from standard UNIX prototypes.<br></p>
	
	<h2>2.1.5 MINIX</h2><br><p  style="font-size:140%" >
	MINIX is a free, open-source, operating system designed to be highly reliable, flexible,
	and secure. It is based on a tiny microkernel running in kernel mode with the rest of the
	operating system running as a collection of isolated, protected, processes in user mode.
	MINIX incorporates microkernel architecture which is difficult to understand for novice
	students. Also current MINIX version is now become a high end operating system and
	it’s no more a pedagogical operating system now.<br></p>
	
	<h2>2.1.6 Plan 9</h2><br><p  style="font-size:140%" >
	Plan 9 is a research system developed at Bell Labs starting in the late 1980s. Its
	original designers and authors were Ken Thompson, Rob Pike, Dave Presotto, and Phil
	Winterbottom. Plan 9 is an operating system kernel but also a collection of accompanying
	software. The bulk of the software is predominantly new, written for Plan 9 rather than
	ported from Unix or other systems. The main problem with this operating system, as it
	has been evolved since 1980s, it has become a full fledge operating system instead of just
	a research system.<br></p>
	
	<h2>2.1.7 Xv6</h2><br><p  style="font-size:140%" >
	xv6 is a simple unix-like teaching operating system developed at MIT [13]. xv6 is re-
	implementation of Dennis Ritchies and Ken Thompsons Unix Version 6 (v6). xv6 is
	implemented in ANSI C for an x86 based multiprocessors. Xv6 is simple enough to teach
	operating system walking through its code in a semester. xv6 has implemented most of
	modern operating system core functionalists which makes easier to start look through in
	oper- ating system code for a newbie. Xv6 is around 8000 lines code yet still contains the
	important concepts and organization of Unix. Current users of xv6 include MIT[6],Yale
	[11],Columbia university, IIT Delhi.<br></p>
	
	<h2>2.2 Components of prototype operating systems</h2><br><p  style="font-size:140%" >
	The selected operating system should have one language process system process either
	interpreter or compiler. It should also have a minimal library on top of which utilities
	can run. We have studied such exiting solutions.<br></p>
	
	<h2>2.2.1 Introduction to Picoc</h2><br><p  style="font-size:140%" >
	PicoC is a very small C interpreter for scripting. It was originally written as the
	script language for a UAV’s on-board flight system. It’s also very suitable for other
	robotic, embedded and non-embedded applications. The core C source code is around
	4500 lines of code. It’s not intended to be a complete implementation of ISO C but it
	has all the essentials. When compiled it only takes very little code space and is also very
	sparing of data space. This means it can work well in small embedded devices. It’s also
	a fun example of how to create a very small language implementation while still keeping
	the code readable. The overall structure and it’s open source nature is the key reason to
	choose Picoc as a prototype interpreter in current xv6 os.<br></p>
	
	<h2>2.2.2 Introduction to dietlibc</h2><br><p  style="font-size:140%" >
	Dietlibc is a C standard library released under the GNU General Public License Version
	2, but there are also commercial licences available. It was developed with the help of about
	100 volunteers by Felix von Leitner with the goal to compile and link programs to the
	smallest possible size. Dietlibc was developed from scratch and thus only implements the
	most important and commonly used functions. It is mainly used in embedded devices.
	Dietlibc is easy to build on linux operating systems and have quite flexible licensing policy
	which makes it the best choice for using this as a standard library in current xv6 kernel.
